# calculatorV2
A second attempt at building a calculator on a web page.

13/05/22

Completed:

Dividing by zero has been dealt with.

Only one decimal place allowed to be used.

Clear button is functional.

Backspace button is functional.

Decimals are rounded up using precision. 

No bugs found, pressing operators and equals cause no issue for the user/calculator.

Aesthetics have been touched up on, internal code has been organised slightly.

For future updates:

Include keyboard support.
